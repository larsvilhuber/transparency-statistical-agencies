## What is a replication package?

- [AEA Data and Code Availability policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy)
- [Data and Code Availability Standard](https://datacodestandard.org/) ![](https://datacodestandard.org/assets/img/DCAS-1.0.png) 
- [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies)

## AEA policy

![](images/aea-dcap-top.png)

## Tenets of the Policy

- **Transparency** 
- **Completeness** 
- **Preservation**

## Transparency

- Provenance of the *data*
- Processing of the data, from raw data to results (code)

> It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish
papers only if the **data** used in the analysis are **clearly and precisely documented** and **access** to the data and code is **clearly and precisely documented** and is non-exclusive to the authors.


## Completeness

- All data needs to be identified and and access described
- All code needs to be described and provided 

> Authors ... must provide, prior to acceptance, the
**data, programs, and other details** of the computations **sufficient** to
permit replication
 
## Preservation

- All data needs to be preserved for future replicators
  - Ideally, within the replication package, subject to ToU, for convenience
  - Otherwise, in a **trusted repository**

## Preservation

- Code must be in a trusted repository
  - Usually, within the replication package
  - Websites, Github, are *not acceptable*


## Example of deposit

## Side note: Government

- Data are often confidential
  - Are they preserved? (**NARA**, otherwise)
  - Are they accessible to others? (**FSRDC, NORC**, etc.)
- Code is sometimes deemed "confidential"
  - We will return to this topic!

## Exceptions to the Policy

None

## ...

... there is a grey zone:

- When data do not belong to researcher, no control over preservation, access!
- Sometimes, ToU prevent researcher from revealing metadata (name of company, location)

## Transparency again

- However: 
  - No exception for need to **describe** access (own and other)
  - No exception for need to fully **describe** processing (possibly with redacted code)

# Enforcement of the AEA Policy

## Reproducibility?

## Reproducibility 

> "Reproducibility" refers to the ability of a
researcher to duplicate the results of a prior
study using the same materials and
procedures as were used by the original
investigator." [^Bollen]

[^Bollen]: Bollen et al. 2015. "Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Perspectives on Robust and Reliable Science."

## Testing for ...

- **Transparency** 
- **Completeness** 

through **reproducibility**


## Criteria: Transparency?

- Can a reasonable person understand the description of **acquisition of data** and **processing** via code?

## Criteria: Completeness?

- Do the provided materials allow to reproduce all the **tables** and **figures** in the paper?

## Who is the target person?

## Who is the target person?

- **You** (in 4 years, between prepping 2 new courses,
an R&R, a new child, and tenure coming up in 2
years)
- **Your RA** (in 4 years, because you are… see above)
- Your **future readers** who will cite you (in 4-10 years, who may want to extend or replicate
your study, but won’t if it is too complex)
