# Wrapping it all up

## What is the state of reproducibility and transparency in academic economics?

- An increasing number of journals are not just **requiring** complete data, code, and transparent description, but also **verifying** that the code and data are correct.
- At the AEA: since 2019, reviewed around **1700** articles, ran code for about **2/3** of them.

## What are the benefits of reproducibility and transparency?

- Greater **trust** in the results
- Greater **ease** of building on results
- Greater **transparency** of the process, but also of the **provenance**

## Increasing broad consensus in academia

- FAIR principles
- Data Citation Principles
- Computational Reproducibility 

## What are the implications for statistical agencies?

## Producers of statistical products

- May want to provide greater transparency into the **production process**.
- May need to do more for **long-term, unbiased preservation** of input data, output products, and code/software to link the two.
- May want to start with the low-hanging fruit: dashboards and fully public processes.

## Coherence with stated principles

The emerging consensus is fully in line with the decades-strong principles of statistical agencies:

## Greater trust by the public?

- **Transparency** should be correlated with greater trust in the work of the statistical agencies
