## United Nations

Fundamental Principles of 
Official Statistics, **Principle 3**:

> *Accountability and Transparency*
To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, 
the statistical agencies are to present information 
according to scientific standards on the sources, 
methods and procedures of the statistics [^UNprinciples]

## National Academies

Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency, **Principle 2**: 

> Credibility among Data Users
A federal statistical agency must have credibility
with those who use its data and information [^CNSTAT]

"... flow of
objective, **credible** statistics to support
the decisions of individuals,
households, governments, businesses,
and other organizations."


## OMB

Statistical Policy Directive No. 1, 4:

"Any **loss of trust** in the
integrity of the Federal statistical system
and its products could lessen
respondent cooperation with Federal
statistical surveys, decrease the quality
of statistical system products, and foster
uncertainty about the validity of
measures our Nation uses to monitor
and assess its performance and progress."
